# Postman
Postman is the complete toolchain for API developers, makes API development faster, easier, and better.

## Getting Started

### Documentation

You can read more on their official [docs](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/).

### Basic Installation

Postman also available on mac, windows and linux. You can grab the bundle on [getpostman](https://www.getpostman.com/apps), but if you are `linux`us`er` just go to terminal and drive it! This is not apt-get install postman but an apt-get-install-postman.sh :smiling_imp:

#### via curl

```shell
bash <(wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CreatorB/Postman/master/apt-get-install-postman.sh)
```

## How it works

Postman recommends installing its native app, but there wasnâ€™t any documentation for installing it on Ubuntu until this repo created. So, in order to make it easier for fellow Ubuntu/Linux users to start with Postman, this is! :sunglasses:
